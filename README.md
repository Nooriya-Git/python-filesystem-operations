# Python Filesystem Operations  

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic filesystem operations using the `os` and `shutil` modules. The scripts were executed in a Jupyter Notebook to create, manipulate, and delete files and directories efficiently.  

## **Operations Performed**  
The scripts cover the following filesystem tasks:  
- Creating a new directory  
- Listing all files and directories in the current working directory  
- Creating a text file inside the new directory and writing content to it  
- Reading the contents of the created text file  
- Renaming the text file  
- Listing the files inside the directory after renaming  
- Deleting the directory along with its contents  

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook (for execution)  

## **Usage**  
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-filesystem-operations.git
cd python-filesystem-operations
jupyter notebook
